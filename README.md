# Lord Ganesha Project


## Overview

The **Lord Ganesha** project is a web application created for the **Prathm Code Competition**. This project has been a fulfilling journey for me, allowing me to express my **creativity** and **technical skills**. I truly enjoyed crafting the **SVG representation** of Lord Ganesha, which helped me blend my creative thoughts with my technical abilities.

## Technologies Used

- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templates for rendering dynamic HTML.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage and creating a beautiful user experience.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js to build the backend of the application.
